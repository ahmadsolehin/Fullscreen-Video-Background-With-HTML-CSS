    <p>If they say, Who cares if one more light goes out In the sky of a million stars? It flickers, flickers. Who cares when someone's time runs out If a moment is all we are? Or quicker, quicker. Who cares if one more light goes out? Well, I do.</p>

    <p>Should've stayed. Were there signs I ignored?
Can I help you not to hurt anymore?
We saw brilliance when the world was asleep.
There are things that we can have but can't keep!</p>

    <p>The reminders pull the floor from your feet.
In the kitchen one more chair than you need.
Oh.
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair.
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there.
